# About This Course

This course teaches you how to leverage AI-assisted tools to transform learning objectives into interactive educational simulations called MicroSims. This course bridges the gap between abstract pedagogical goals and concrete, interactive learning experiences.

You'll learn to analyze learning objectives using Bloom's Taxonomy, select appropriate visualization paradigms, write effective specifications, and generate working simulations—all without writing code yourself.

## Who This Course Is For

- K-12 Teachers
- Corporate Training Specialists
- Higher Education Faculty
- Instructional Designers at EdTech companies
- Curriculum Developers
- Subject Matter Experts

No programming experience required. The course focuses on specification, evaluation, and iteration rather than implementation details.

## What You'll Learn

- **Bloom's Taxonomy Analysis** - Classify objectives by cognitive complexity
- **Visualization Paradigms** - Match concepts to the right visual representation (p5.js, vis-network, Chart.js, Mermaid, and more)
- **MicroSim Specifications** - Write detailed blueprints that AI can implement
- **Cognitive Load Design** - Create effective learning experiences
- **Quality Evaluation** - Assess simulations across technical, pedagogical, and UX dimensions
- **Iterative Refinement** - Test with users and improve designs
