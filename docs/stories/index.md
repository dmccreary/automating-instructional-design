This graphic novel traces the intellectual journey of Benjamin Bloom and his collaborators as they confront the challenge of defining and organizing human learning, beginning in the uncertainty of mid-20th-century education and culminating in a framework that reshaped teaching worldwide. Through collaboration, reflection, and revision—especially the later work of Bloom’s students such as David Krathwohl—the taxonomy evolves from a static hierarchy into a dynamic, living model that better reflects how people think, learn, and create. As the story advances into the digital age, Bloom’s ideas become embedded in instructional design, learning analytics, and intelligent educational systems, quietly guiding both human educators and machines. The narrative closes by revealing Bloom’s enduring legacy: a human-centered structure for learning that continues to adapt while preserving its core insight—that understanding can be built, shared, and elevated through thoughtful design.
