# Anticipating Misconceptions

## Summary

This chapter focuses on understanding and addressing learner misconceptions through MicroSim design. You will learn about mental models and how they form, identify common misconceptions by subject area, and understand the difference between misconception correction and reinforcement. The chapter covers productive failure approaches, prediction prompts, conceptual boundaries, conceptual change processes, intuition testing, and model comparison techniques. These strategies help you design simulations that effectively challenge and correct faulty mental models.
