# Adapting for Audience Levels

## Summary

This chapter explores how to adapt MicroSim designs for different audiences based on cognitive development theory. You will learn about Piaget's stages and Vygotsky's theories, then apply this knowledge to design for specific audiences: early childhood (touch targets, simple cause-effect), elementary (guided exploration, scaffolded complexity), middle school (abstract concepts, multiple variables, hypothesis testing), high school (real-world applications, data interpretation), undergraduate (theoretical foundations, mathematical relationships), graduate (research applications, parameter spaces), and corporate training (job-relevant scenarios, time-efficient design).
