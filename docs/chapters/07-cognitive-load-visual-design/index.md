# Cognitive Load and Visual Design

## Summary

This chapter explores the cognitive science principles that underpin effective MicroSim design. You will learn about working memory and long-term memory systems, schema formation, and cognitive load theory including intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load. The chapter covers the split attention effect, progressive disclosure techniques, information density management, visual simplicity, animation speed control, and learner control mechanisms. Understanding these principles will help you create simulations that optimize mental effort and support effective learning.
