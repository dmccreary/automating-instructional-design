# Quiz: Cognitive Load and Visual Design

Test your understanding of cognitive load theory, working memory limitations, and design principles that optimize learning in MicroSims.

#### 1. What is the approximate capacity of working memory?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Unlimited storage with slow access
2. 4-7 chunks of information
3. 15-30 items held indefinitely
4. 100+ elements processed simultaneously
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Working memory can only hold about 4-7 chunks of information at once, and even that's optimistic for complex material. This isn't a flaw—it's a feature. Working memory is designed for active processing, not storage. Information also fades within 15-30 seconds without rehearsal.

    **Concept Tested:** Working Memory

#### 2. What are schemas in the context of cognitive load theory?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Visual layouts for organizing MicroSim interfaces
2. Organized knowledge structures in long-term memory that help make sense of new information
3. Database structures for storing user data
4. Step-by-step procedures for completing tasks
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Schemas are organized knowledge structures in long-term memory—mental frameworks that help you make sense of new information. They act like the brain's compression algorithm. Instead of remembering every individual detail, you remember patterns and relationships. Schemas reduce cognitive load because experts process information more efficiently through chunking.

    **Concept Tested:** Schema Formation

#### 3. Which type of cognitive load should designers minimize ruthlessly?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Intrinsic load
2. Extraneous load
3. Germane load
4. Mental effort
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Extraneous load is the cognitive effort wasted on things that don't contribute to learning—clutter, confusing layouts, poor instructions, unnecessary complexity. It's entirely under the designer's control and should be minimized ruthlessly. Every bit of extraneous load eliminated gives learners more mental budget for actual learning.

    **Concept Tested:** Extraneous Load

    **See:** [Chapter Content](index.md)

#### 4. What is the split attention effect?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. When learners try to multitask on two unrelated activities
2. When learners must mentally integrate information that is physically or temporally separated
3. When the screen is divided into too many panels
4. When learners switch between different devices
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The split attention effect occurs when learners must mentally integrate multiple sources of information that are physically or temporally separated. For example, when a diagram is on the left and its explanation is in a separate pop-up on the right, learners waste cognitive resources searching for and connecting information instead of understanding it.

    **Concept Tested:** Split Attention Effect

    **See:** [Chapter Content](index.md)

#### 5. What is the primary solution to the split attention effect?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Use more colors to differentiate elements
2. Add audio narration to explain everything
3. Physical integration—place explanations next to the elements they describe
4. Reduce the total amount of content presented
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The antidote to split attention is physical integration. Put the explanation next to the thing it explains. Put labels directly on elements, not in separate legends. Make connections visible so the learner's brain doesn't have to make them. Research shows split attention can reduce learning outcomes by 30-50%.

    **Concept Tested:** Split Attention Effect

#### 6. What is progressive disclosure in MicroSim design?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Showing all features at once so users can explore freely
2. Revealing information gradually rather than all at once
3. Disclosing the source code to advanced users
4. Progressively increasing animation speed
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Progressive disclosure is a design strategy where information is revealed gradually rather than all at once. It reduces initial cognitive load, supports scaffolded learning, maintains engagement through the promise of "more to discover," and enables differentiation so learners can go as deep as they need.

    **Concept Tested:** Progressive Disclosure

    **See:** [Chapter Content](index.md)

#### 7. Why is learner control important for animated MicroSims?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It makes the MicroSim look more professional
2. It allows learners to adjust speed, pause, and replay to match their processing pace
3. It reduces development costs
4. It prevents the animation from running automatically
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Learner control—including play/pause, speed control, and step functions—accommodates individual differences in processing speed, allows review of difficult sections, reduces anxiety, and supports self-regulated learning. Research shows most instructional animations are too fast for effective learning; learner control solves this problem.

    **Concept Tested:** Learner Control, Animation Speed

    **See:** [Chapter Content](index.md)

#### 8. What does the "minimal effective design" principle suggest?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Use the minimum number of colors possible
2. Create the simplest interface that successfully supports the learning objective
3. Minimize the file size of the MicroSim
4. Use minimal text and rely primarily on visuals
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The minimal effective design aims for the simplest interface, fewest features, and least complexity that successfully supports the learning objective. Every element beyond this carries risk of distraction, confusion, and increased cognitive load. Start minimal and add elements only when testing shows they're needed.

    **Concept Tested:** Design Tradeoffs

    **See:** [Chapter Content](index.md)

#### 9. What is germane load, and why is it important?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The load caused by irrelevant decorative elements; it should be eliminated
2. The cognitive effort dedicated to actual learning, including building schemas; it should be maximized
3. The inherent difficulty of the material; it cannot be changed
4. The mental effort spent navigating the interface; it should be reduced
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Germane load is the cognitive effort dedicated to actual learning—processing information deeply, making connections, building schemas, and achieving understanding. This is the "good" load that produces learning. The design goal is to minimize extraneous load so learners can invest maximum mental effort in germane load.

    **Concept Tested:** Germane Load

    **See:** [Chapter Content](index.md)

#### 10. According to cognitive load theory, what determines intrinsic load?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The quality of the visual design
2. Element interactivity (how many pieces must be processed simultaneously) and prior knowledge
3. The number of animation frames per second
4. How long the learner spends on the MicroSim
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Intrinsic load is determined by two factors: element interactivity (how many pieces of information must be processed simultaneously) and prior knowledge (what schemas the learner already has). Intrinsic load is fixed for a given learner learning a given topic—you can't make calculus inherently simpler without changing what calculus is. However, you can manage it through sequencing and building prerequisite schemas.

    **Concept Tested:** Intrinsic Load
