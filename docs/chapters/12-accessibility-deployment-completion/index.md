# Accessibility, Deployment, and Course Completion

## Summary

This final chapter covers three essential areas for completing your MicroSim development journey. First, you will learn accessibility principles including universal design, UDL principles, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, color blindness design, reduced motion preferences, multilingual support, vocabulary considerations, cultural sensitivity, prior knowledge support, differentiation strategies, accessibility auditing, and constraint simulation. Second, the deployment section covers LMS integration, intelligent textbooks, learning analytics, interaction tracking, maintenance planning, library organization, educator collaboration, and content sharing. Finally, you will complete your portfolio project, maintain a reflection journal, engage in peer feedback, and conduct self-evaluation to demonstrate mastery.
