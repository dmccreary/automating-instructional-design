# Visualization Libraries and Tools

## Summary

This chapter introduces the JavaScript libraries and tools used to implement MicroSims. You will learn about p5.js for animations, vis-network for relationship graphs, vis-timeline for temporal displays, Chart.js and Plotly for data visualizations, Leaflet for maps, and Mermaid for diagrams. The chapter also covers Claude Code skills, the MicroSim generator, template libraries, and code generation workflows. By understanding these tools, you will be able to select the right technology for implementing any visualization paradigm.
