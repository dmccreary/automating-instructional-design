# Writing Effective MicroSim Specifications

## Summary

This chapter teaches you how to write clear, complete specifications for MicroSim development. You will learn the anatomy of a specification document, how to describe visual elements without writing code, and how to specify interaction behaviors and constraints. The chapter covers defining success criteria, documenting edge cases, avoiding specification ambiguity, preserving pedagogical intent, and understanding how AI interprets your specifications. These skills ensure that generated MicroSims match your educational vision.
