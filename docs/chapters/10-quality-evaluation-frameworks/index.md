# Quality Evaluation Frameworks

## Summary

This chapter presents comprehensive frameworks for evaluating MicroSim quality across three dimensions: technical, pedagogical, and user experience. You will learn output validation techniques, functionality and responsiveness testing methods, and bug identification strategies. The chapter covers pedagogical evaluation including objective alignment, cognitive level matching, and effectiveness measurement. UX evaluation addresses intuitiveness and engagement balance. You will also learn rubric development, automated versus human evaluation methods, documentation standards, and designing for reusability.
