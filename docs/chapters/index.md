a portion of an intelligent textbook with MicroSims.

## How to Use This Textbook

This textbook follows a carefully designed learning progression where each chapter builds on concepts from previous chapters. The dependency structure ensures that prerequisite knowledge is always introduced before it is needed. We recommend completing chapters in order, especially for your first reading, as later chapters assume familiarity with earlier material.

Each chapter includes a list of concepts covered and identifies which previous chapters contain prerequisite material. Use these guides to create a personalized learning path if you need to focus on specific topics.
