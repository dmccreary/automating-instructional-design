# Generating MicroSims with AI Tools

## Summary

This chapter teaches you how to effectively use AI tools to generate MicroSims from your specifications. You will learn prompt engineering techniques for effective communication with AI systems, how to craft refinement prompts for iterative improvement, and understand the complete generation workflow. The chapter covers output interpretation, issue identification, making regeneration decisions versus manual adjustments, version control practices, and iteration management strategies. These skills enable you to collaborate effectively with AI tools throughout the MicroSim development process.
