# User Testing and Iteration

## Summary

This chapter covers user testing methodologies and the iterative refinement process for MicroSims. You will learn think-aloud protocols, A/B testing design, and techniques for gathering learner feedback across different ages and abilities. The chapter addresses observation techniques, test interpretation, ethical research considerations, and the complete design-test-refine cycle. You will also master change prioritization, distinguishing critical from nice-to-have changes, deciding between fundamental redesign and incremental improvement, preventing scope creep, defining completion criteria, maintaining change logs, and documenting design rationale.
