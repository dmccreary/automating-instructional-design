#### 1. What is a visualization paradigm?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A specific JavaScript library for creating charts
2. A fundamental approach to representing information visually—the underlying structure that organizes information
3. A color scheme used in educational materials
4. A type of interactive button control
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A visualization paradigm is a fundamental approach to representing information visually—the "shape" of your visualization. It's not the specific colors or labels, but the underlying structure that organizes information. Choosing the right paradigm is like choosing the right vehicle for a journey; each type serves different purposes.

#### 2. When would you choose a motion simulation over a network graph?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. When showing relationships between entities
2. When visualizing hierarchical organizational structures
3. When teaching concepts involving continuous change over time, like projectile motion or pendulum oscillations
4. When classifying items into categories
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Motion simulations are ideal when teaching concepts involving continuous change over time, where objects move through space and physics plays a role. Examples include projectile motion, pendulums, and oscillations. Network graphs are better for showing relationships between entities, while classification displays are better for categorizing items.

    **Concept Tested:** Motion Simulation

#### 3. What distinguishes a dynamic system simulation from a simple motion simulation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Dynamic systems use more colors
2. Dynamic systems involve multiple variables that interact and influence each other over time with feedback loops
3. Dynamic systems run faster
4. Dynamic systems only work on mobile devices
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Dynamic systems represent simulations where multiple variables interact and influence each other over time, involving feedback loops, equilibrium states, and emergent behavior. Unlike simple motion where one object follows a trajectory, dynamic systems show how changes in one variable affect others—like predator-prey ecosystems where rabbit and fox populations influence each other.

    **Concept Tested:** Dynamic Systems

#### 4. A network graph consists of which two fundamental elements?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Colors and labels
2. Nodes (entities) and edges (relationships)
3. X-axis and Y-axis
4. Headers and footers
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A network graph consists of nodes (vertices), which are the entities being related, and edges (links), which are the relationships between those entities. From this simple foundation of two components, we can represent complex relationships like social networks, concept dependencies, and organizational structures.

    **Concept Tested:** Network Graph

#### 5. What visualization would be most appropriate for showing that mammals, aquatic animals, and warm-blooded creatures share some overlapping members?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Timeline
2. Venn Diagram
3. Flowchart
4. Trend Chart
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Venn diagrams are perfect for showing set membership and overlapping categories. They visually represent which items belong to multiple groups by placing them in the overlapping regions of circles. The example of mammals, aquatic animals, and warm-blooded creatures is ideal for a Venn diagram because these categories have overlapping members (like whales, which are both mammals and aquatic).

    **Concept Tested:** Venn Diagram

    **See:** [Venn Diagrams: The Classic Overlap](#venn-diagrams-the-classic-overlap)

#### 6. When would you choose a state machine diagram over a flowchart?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. When the process has a single start and end point
2. When you want to show a linear sequence of steps
3. When the current state of the system matters and affects what can happen next
4. When you need to display geographic locations
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. State machine diagrams are preferred when the current state matters for understanding behavior—when the system "remembers" where it is and that affects what can happen next. Flowcharts are better for showing linear processes that start, execute, and end. State machines focus on conditions the system can be in and transitions between them.

    **Concept Tested:** State Machine Diagram

    **See:** [State Machine Diagrams: Being vs. Doing](#state-machine-diagrams-being-vs-doing)

#### 7. What do concept characteristics help you determine?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The budget required for developing the MicroSim
2. The appropriate visualization paradigm by analyzing properties like temporality, relationship structure, and causality
3. The programming language to use
4. The target audience's age
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Concept characteristics are inherent properties of educational content that suggest appropriate visualization approaches. By analyzing characteristics like temporality (does time matter?), relationship structure (hierarchical or networked?), quantitative nature, spatial organization, and causality, you can systematically match concepts to the best paradigm.

#### 8. A teacher wants to visualize how stock prices changed over the past year. Which visualization paradigm is most appropriate?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Venn Diagram
2. Network Graph
3. Trend Chart
4. Classification Display
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Trend charts (typically line charts) are designed to show how values change over continuous time or another continuous variable. They answer questions like "Is it going up or down?", "How fast is it changing?", and "Are there cycles or patterns?"—exactly what's needed for stock price visualization.

    **Concept Tested:** Trend Chart

#### 9. What are visual affordances in the context of MicroSim design?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The cost of visual elements
2. Design properties that suggest how an element can be used or interacted with
3. The number of colors used in a visualization
4. The file size of images
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Visual affordances are design properties that suggest how an element can be used or interacted with. A button looks "clickable," a slider looks "draggable," and a network looks "explorable." Understanding affordances helps match visualization to learning activity—if learners need to "analyze relationships," give them an explorable network; if they need to "classify items," give them a sorting activity.

    **Concept Tested:** Visual Affordances

#### 10. Which visualization paradigm would best show the steps involved in how a bill becomes a law, with decision points where the bill can be rejected or amended?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Scatter Plot
2. Flowchart
3. Distribution Chart
4. Spatial Map
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Flowcharts are perfect for showing processes with decisions, branches, and different possible paths. The process of how a bill becomes a law involves sequential steps and decision points (like votes that can pass or fail), making a flowchart the ideal choice. Flowcharts use rectangles for processes, diamonds for decisions, and arrows for flow.
