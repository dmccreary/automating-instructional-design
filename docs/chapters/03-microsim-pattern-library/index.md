# The MicroSim Pattern Library

## Summary

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of visualization paradigms used in MicroSim development. You will explore motion simulations, physics engines, dynamic systems, and cause-effect displays. The chapter covers relationship graphs, hierarchies, dependency mapping, and influence diagrams for network-style visualizations. You will also learn about sequence displays, timelines, charts for trends and distributions, spatial visualizations, flowcharts, state machines, and classification displays. By mastering these patterns, you will be able to select the most appropriate visualization approach for any learning objective.
