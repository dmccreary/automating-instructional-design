# Prerequisite Analysis and MicroSim Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter introduces the core concepts of MicroSims and interactive simulations while teaching you how to analyze prerequisite knowledge and concept dependencies. You will learn to identify assumed knowledge, map learning pathways, and assess whether a learning objective is ready for simulation. These skills are essential for designing effective educational simulations that meet learners where they are and build on their existing knowledge.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 8 concepts from the learning graph:

1. MicroSim
2. Interactive Simulation
3. AI-Assisted Design
4. Prerequisite Knowledge
5. Assumed Knowledge
6. Simulation Readiness
7. Concept Dependencies
8. Learning Pathway

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:
