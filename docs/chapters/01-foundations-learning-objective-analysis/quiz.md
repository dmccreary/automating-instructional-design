#### 1. What is the definition of instructional design?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The process of creating interactive simulations for classroom use
2. The systematic process of creating educational experiences that make learning efficient, effective, and enjoyable
3. A framework for categorizing educational technology tools
4. The practice of using AI to generate lesson plans automatically
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Instructional design is the systematic process of creating educational experiences that make learning efficient, effective, and enjoyable. It involves analyzing learner needs, designing experiences that bridge knowledge gaps, and evaluating whether those experiences work. Option A describes MicroSims specifically, not instructional design broadly. Option C describes taxonomies or classification systems. Option D describes one application of AI, not instructional design itself.

#### 2. What are the six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy in order from lowest to highest cognitive complexity?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Know, Comprehend, Use, Examine, Judge, Build
2. Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create
3. Recall, Interpret, Execute, Compare, Critique, Design
4. Identify, Explain, Solve, Differentiate, Assess, Produce
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy in the 2001 revised version are: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. These represent increasing levels of cognitive complexity, with Remember being the foundation and Create being the highest level. The other options use similar concepts but are not the official terminology of the revised Bloom's Taxonomy.

    **Concept Tested:** Bloom's Taxonomy

#### 3. Why is the verb "understand" problematic when writing learning objectives?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It is too difficult for students to achieve
2. It only applies to the Remember level of Bloom's Taxonomy
3. It describes an internal mental state that cannot be directly observed or measured
4. It is considered outdated terminology in modern instructional design
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. "Understand" is problematic because it describes an internal mental state that cannot be directly observed or measured. Good learning objectives require observable action verbs like "explain," "compare," "classify," or "predict" that demonstrate understanding through visible behavior. How would you know if someone truly "understands" something without observable evidence?

    **Concept Tested:** Action Verbs

    **See:** [Chapter Content](index.md)

#### 4. What is an atomic concept?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A learning objective that focuses on chemistry or physics topics
2. A single, indivisible unit of knowledge or skill that can be taught and assessed independently
3. The highest level of cognitive complexity in Bloom's Taxonomy
4. A type of interactive simulation used for science education
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An atomic concept is a single, indivisible unit of knowledge or skill that can be taught and assessed independently. It's the smallest meaningful piece of information that serves as a building block for more complex understanding. Examples include the definition of "mean" in statistics or the formula for the area of a rectangle. The term "atomic" refers to being indivisible, not to atomic physics.

    **Concept Tested:** Atomic Concepts

#### 5. According to the chapter, what distinguishes a good learning objective from a vague one?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Good objectives use complex vocabulary while vague ones use simple language
2. Good objectives describe observable, measurable behaviors while vague ones describe internal mental states
3. Good objectives are longer and more detailed while vague ones are short
4. Good objectives focus on content while vague ones focus on activities
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Good learning objectives describe observable, measurable behaviors (like "predict the trajectory of a falling object"), while vague objectives describe internal mental states that cannot be directly observed (like "understand gravity"). The magic question to ask is: "How would I know if a student achieved this?" If you can't describe a concrete way to assess it, the objective needs work.

#### 6. Which Bloom's level involves making judgments based on criteria and standards?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Analyze
2. Create
3. Evaluate
4. Apply
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The Evaluate level involves making judgments based on criteria and standards. This includes checking for errors, critiquing work, judging effectiveness, and justifying decisions with evidence. Evaluation requires both understanding the subject matter and applying appropriate criteria to assess it. Analyze involves breaking material into parts. Create involves producing something new. Apply involves using procedures.

    **Concept Tested:** Evaluate Level

#### 7. What is the purpose of objective decomposition?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To simplify learning objectives so they are easier for students to understand
2. To break compound objectives into their atomic components, revealing prerequisites and sequence
3. To convert action verbs into Bloom's Taxonomy levels
4. To eliminate unnecessary learning objectives from a curriculum
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Objective decomposition is the process of breaking compound objectives into their atomic components. This process reveals prerequisites (what must learners already know), sequence (in what order concepts should be taught), assessment points (where we can check for understanding), and scaffolding needs (where learners might need extra support). This is especially important for AI-assisted design, as AI tools work best with clear, specific instructions.

    **Concept Tested:** Objective Decomposition

#### 8. Given the learning objective "Students will analyze a case study to identify the root cause of a project failure," at which Bloom's level does this objective operate?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Understand
2. Apply
3. Analyze
4. Evaluate
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. This objective operates at the Analyze level because it requires learners to break material (the case study) into constituent parts and determine relationships (identifying the root cause). The verb "analyze" directly indicates this level. Additionally, identifying root causes requires differentiating between relevant and irrelevant information and organizing findings into a coherent structure—key characteristics of the Analyze level.

    **Concept Tested:** Analyze Level

    **See:** [Chapter Content](index.md)

#### 9. What is the difference between a learning objective and a learning outcome?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Learning objectives are for K-12 education; learning outcomes are for higher education
2. Learning objectives state what we intend for students to learn; learning outcomes are what students actually learned
3. Learning objectives use action verbs; learning outcomes use noun phrases
4. Learning objectives are measurable; learning outcomes are not measurable
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A learning objective is what we intend for students to learn (the goal), while a learning outcome is what students actually learned (the result). In a perfect world, these would be identical, but in reality there's often a gap between intended objectives and actual outcomes. Good assessment helps measure this gap and determine whether instruction was effective.

    **Concept Tested:** Learning Outcome

    **See:** [Chapter Content](index.md)

#### 10. A curriculum designer writes the objective: "Students will design and implement a RESTful API that handles user authentication and data validation." What type of objective is this, and what should be done with it?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It is an atomic concept and should be used as-is for assessment
2. It is a compound objective and should be decomposed into multiple atomic concepts
3. It is a Remember-level objective and should be elevated to a higher Bloom's level
4. It is a measurable outcome and should be converted into a learning objective
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. This is a compound objective that bundles multiple skills together: understanding RESTful architecture, designing API endpoints, implementing code, understanding authentication, implementing authentication mechanisms, understanding data validation, and implementing validation logic. For effective instruction and assessment, it should be decomposed into its atomic components. This helps diagnose where students struggle and ensures proper sequencing of instruction.
