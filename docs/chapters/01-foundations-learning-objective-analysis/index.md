# Foundations of Learning Objective Analysis

## Summary

This chapter establishes the foundational knowledge needed for instructional design and learning objective analysis. You will learn about Bloom's Taxonomy and its six cognitive complexity levels, understand how to classify learning objectives by cognitive demand, and master the use of action verbs to create measurable outcomes. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to analyze learning objectives systematically and identify their cognitive complexity level, setting the stage for designing effective MicroSims.
