## About This MicroSim

The Misconception Catalog is a browsable reference of common student misconceptions organized by subject domain, designed to help instructional designers anticipate learner beliefs when creating educational content and MicroSims.

### Why Misconceptions Matter for Instructional Design

Students rarely arrive at learning experiences as "blank slates." They bring prior knowledge, intuitive beliefs, and mental models shaped by everyday experience. Many of these beliefs are misconceptions - ideas that feel intuitively correct but conflict with scientific or mathematical understanding.

Effective instructional design must:

1. **Anticipate** what misconceptions learners likely hold
2. **Address** these beliefs directly through conceptual conflict
3. **Provide** alternative explanations that are both correct and intuitive
4. **Create** opportunities for learners to test their beliefs

### How to Use This Catalog

**For MicroSim Designers:**

- Browse by domain to find misconceptions relevant to your content
- Use the "Add to My List" feature to collect misconceptions for a specific project
- Review the suggested interventions for ideas on how to design corrective experiences
- Check related misconceptions to ensure comprehensive coverage

**Interactive Features:**

- **Domain Tabs**: Filter misconceptions by subject area (Physics, Biology, Mathematics, etc.)
- **Search**: Find misconceptions by keyword across all domains
- **Grade Level Filter**: Focus on misconceptions common at specific educational levels
- **Sort Options**: Order by prevalence (most common) or difficulty to correct
- **Expand Cards**: Click to reveal detailed explanations, interventions, and research citations
- **My List**: Save misconceptions to a personal list for your design project
- **Export**: Download your list as JSON for integration with other tools

### Understanding the Card Information

Each misconception card displays:

- **Domain**: The subject area (color-coded for quick identification)
- **Difficulty to Correct**: Easy (E), Medium (M), or Hard (H) - indicating how resistant the misconception is to instruction
- **Misconception Statement**: The incorrect belief as typically expressed
- **Why It Seems True**: Explanation of why students find this belief intuitive
- **Correct Concept**: The scientifically accurate understanding
- **Prevalence**: Approximate percentage of students holding this misconception (where research is available)
- **Grade Level**: When this misconception is most commonly encountered
- **Tags**: Related concepts for cross-referencing

### Designing Against Misconceptions

When you identify a misconception relevant to your MicroSim, consider these design strategies:

1. **Prediction-Observation-Explanation (POE)**: Have learners predict an outcome based on their beliefs, observe what actually happens, then explain the discrepancy

2. **Bridging Analogies**: Connect the correct concept to learners' existing correct knowledge

3. **Extreme Cases**: Use boundary conditions or extreme examples where the misconception clearly fails

4. **Visual Contradiction**: Show simulations that produce unexpected results under the misconception

5. **Multiple Representations**: Present the same concept in different forms (graphical, numerical, verbal)

## Research Foundation

The misconceptions in this catalog are drawn from peer-reviewed educational research spanning decades of cognitive science and discipline-based education research. Each entry includes a citation to the original research.

Key sources include:

- Physics education research on force and motion misconceptions
- Mathematics education studies on arithmetic and algebraic thinking
- Biology education research on evolution and cellular processes
- Cognitive psychology literature on persistent myths

## Lesson Plan Ideas

### Activity: Misconception Hunt

Have instructional design students:

1. Select a topic they plan to create content for
2. Use the catalog to identify 3-5 relevant misconceptions
3. Research one misconception in depth
4. Design a brief intervention activity that addresses it
5. Test the intervention with peers who role-play as naive learners

### Discussion Questions

1. Why do some misconceptions persist even after direct instruction?
2. How might a MicroSim inadvertently reinforce a misconception?
3. What makes some misconceptions harder to correct than others?
4. How can we distinguish between gaps in knowledge and true misconceptions?

## Technical Notes

- Data persists in browser localStorage for the "My List" feature
- Export produces JSON format compatible with common data processing tools
- The interface is fully responsive for different screen sizes
