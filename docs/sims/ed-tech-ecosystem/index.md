## Description

This interactive diagram visualizes the ecosystem of educational technology as a series of concentric rings centered on the **Learner**. The visualization demonstrates how different technology layers work together to support and enhance the learning experience.

### Interactive Features

- **Hover** over any component to see its description and role in the ecosystem
- **Click** on a component to see examples of specific tools in that category
- **Navigate** using the built-in navigation buttons (zoom and pan)

### The Four Rings

#### Center: The Learner (Orange)
At the heart of all educational technology is the learner. Every tool, platform, and service in the ecosystem exists to support their learning journey.

#### Inner Ring: Direct Learning Tools (Blue)
These are the tools that learners interact with directly:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **MicroSims** | Interactive simulations for hands-on exploration |
| **Video Content** | Pre-recorded and live video instruction |
| **Reading Materials** | Text-based educational resources |
| **Practice Exercises** | Activities for applying knowledge |

#### Middle Ring: Support Systems (Green)
Platforms that organize, manage, and enhance the learning experience:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **LMS** | Learning Management Systems that organize courses |
| **Assessment Tools** | Evaluation and feedback systems |
| **Communication Platforms** | Collaboration and interaction tools |
| **Content Authoring Tools** | Software for creating educational content |

#### Outer Ring: Infrastructure (Gray)
The technological foundation that enables everything:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Cloud Services** | Scalable hosting and computing |
| **Analytics Platforms** | Data collection and learning insights |
| **AI/ML Services** | Artificial intelligence for personalization |
| **Accessibility Tools** | Ensuring content is available to all |

## Understanding the Connections

Each edge in the diagram is labeled to show the relationship between components:

- **Inner Ring to Learner**: Shows how learners engage (explores, watches, studies, practices)
- **Middle Ring to Inner Ring**: Shows support functions (delivers, organizes, evaluates, creates)
- **Outer Ring to Middle Ring**: Shows infrastructure services (hosts, scales, tracks, assists)

## Learning Objectives

By exploring this diagram, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** the major categories of educational technology
2. **Explain** how different technology layers interconnect
3. **Understand** the learner-centered approach to ed-tech design
4. **Recognize** examples of tools in each category

## Use Cases

This visualization is useful for:

- **Instructional Designers**: Understanding the technology landscape
- **EdTech Developers**: Seeing where their tools fit in the ecosystem
- **Educators**: Selecting appropriate tools for their needs
- **Students**: Understanding the technologies supporting their learning
