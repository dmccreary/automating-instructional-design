## Description

This interactive MicroSim visualizes the three critical dimensions for evaluating educational simulations. Using an interactive Venn diagram, learners can explore how Technical, Pedagogical, and UX evaluation criteria work together to create high-quality MicroSims.

### The Three Lenses

1. **Technical (Blue)** - Does the simulation work correctly?
   - Functionality without bugs
   - Responsive design across devices
   - Smooth performance
   - Code standardization

2. **Pedagogical (Green)** - Does it teach effectively?
   - Alignment with learning objectives
   - Appropriate cognitive level (Bloom's Taxonomy)
   - Addresses misconceptions
   - Scaffolded difficulty progression

3. **UX (Purple)** - Is it easy and engaging to use?
   - Intuitive controls
   - Balanced engagement (educational, not distracting)
   - Accessibility for all learners
   - Clear visual hierarchy

### Key Intersections

- **Technical + Pedagogical**: Performance doesn't hinder learning
- **Pedagogical + UX**: Engaging AND educational
- **Technical + UX**: Works smoothly on all devices
- **Center (Gold)**: The goal - excellence in all three dimensions

### Interactive Features

- **Hover** over each circle to see its evaluation criteria
- **Click** a circle to view a detailed checklist for that dimension
- **Hover** over intersections to understand overlapping concerns
- The **center pulses** continuously to emphasize the goal of balanced excellence

## Learning Objective

Students will understand how technical, pedagogical, and UX evaluation dimensions interact to form a complete quality assessment framework for educational simulations.

## Embedding This MicroSim

## Lesson Plan

### Objective
Students will apply the three-lens evaluation framework to assess the quality of existing MicroSims.

### Activities

1. **Exploration (5 minutes)**: Have students explore the Venn diagram by hovering over each lens and intersection. Ask them to identify what makes each dimension unique.

2. **Discussion (10 minutes)**: As a class, discuss:
   - Why are all three dimensions necessary?
   - What happens when one dimension is weak?
   - Can you think of examples where a simulation excels in one area but fails in another?

3. **Application (15 minutes)**: Give students 2-3 MicroSims to evaluate. Using the checklists shown in this visualization, have them rate each simulation on all three dimensions.

4. **Synthesis (10 minutes)**: Students share their evaluations and discuss which MicroSims achieved the "gold center" of high quality across all dimensions.

### Assessment
Students demonstrate understanding by correctly identifying strengths and weaknesses across the three evaluation dimensions for given MicroSim examples.
