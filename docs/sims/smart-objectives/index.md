## About This MicroSim

This interactive infographic explains the SMART framework for writing effective learning objectives. Each letter represents a critical component that makes objectives clear, assessable, and actionable.

### How to Use

1. **Hover** over any panel to highlight it and see the description
2. **Click** on a panel to view additional examples
3. **Click again** to close the examples panel

### The SMART Components

- **S - Specific**: Clearly state what learners will do
- **M - Measurable**: Include criteria for assessment
- **A - Achievable**: Set realistic goals for the learners
- **R - Relevant**: Connect to meaningful real-world applications
- **T - Time-bound**: Specify when objectives should be achieved

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. Explain each component of the SMART framework
2. Evaluate whether a learning objective meets SMART criteria
3. Transform vague objectives into SMART objectives
4. Write original SMART learning objectives

### Suggested Activities

1. **Exploration (5 min)**: Explore all five panels, reading descriptions and examples
2. **Evaluation (10 min)**: Given 10 objectives, mark which are SMART and which are not
3. **Transformation (15 min)**: Rewrite 5 weak objectives to make them SMART
4. **Creation (10 min)**: Write 3 SMART objectives for a topic of your choice

### Assessment

- Quiz on identifying SMART vs non-SMART objectives
- Practical: Write 5 SMART objectives for a lesson plan
