# Portfolio Project Components

This interactive diagram visualizes the eight essential components of a comprehensive MicroSim portfolio project. Each component represents a key deliverable that demonstrates mastery of different aspects of MicroSim development.

## About This MicroSim

The hub-and-spoke diagram shows eight portfolio components organized by development phase:

**Design Phase (Blue)**

- **Learning Objective Analysis** - Define clear learning objectives using Bloom's taxonomy
- **MicroSim Specification** - Create detailed wireframes and interaction patterns

**Implementation Phase (Green)**

- **Working MicroSim** - Build a fully functional, responsive, accessible simulation

**Evaluation Phase (Orange)**

- **Evaluation Rubric** - Develop criteria for technical quality and learning effectiveness
- **User Testing Report** - Conduct and document learner testing
- **Iteration Log** - Track version history and improvement rationale

**Documentation Phase (Purple)**

- **Accessibility Audit** - Perform and document accessibility testing
- **Deployment Documentation** - Record platform setup and maintenance procedures

**Interactive Features:**

- **Hover** over any component to see its key elements
- **Click** on a component to highlight its dependency paths (what it depends on and what depends on it)
- Click elsewhere or on the same component to deselect

## Portfolio Component Details

| Component | Phase | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Learning Objective Analysis | Design | Bloom's level classification, concept decomposition, readiness assessment |
| MicroSim Specification | Design | Visual mockup, interaction specification, accessibility requirements |
| Working MicroSim | Implementation | Functional code, responsive design, accessible implementation |
| Evaluation Rubric | Evaluation | Technical criteria, pedagogical criteria, UX criteria |
| User Testing Report | Evaluation | Testing methodology, findings summary, recommended changes |
| Iteration Log | Evaluation | Version history, change rationale, before/after comparisons |
| Accessibility Audit | Documentation | WCAG test results, issues found, fixes implemented |
| Deployment Documentation | Documentation | Platform setup, integration steps, maintenance plan |

## Dependency Flow

The diagram shows how components build on each other:

1. **Analysis leads to Specification** - Clear objectives enable precise specifications
2. **Specification leads to Implementation** - Detailed specs guide development
3. **Implementation enables Evaluation** - A working MicroSim can be tested and refined
4. **Testing feeds Iteration** - User feedback drives improvements
5. **Iteration cycles back** - Refined versions return to implementation
6. **Implementation enables Documentation** - Working code can be audited and deployed

## Learning Objectives

By completing this portfolio project, students will demonstrate ability to:

1. **Analyze** learning objectives and decompose them into MicroSim requirements
2. **Design** comprehensive specifications with accessibility considerations
3. **Implement** functional, responsive, and accessible interactive simulations
4. **Evaluate** MicroSims using systematic rubrics and user testing
5. **Document** the iterative development process and deployment procedures
6. **Create** a complete portfolio showcasing MicroSim development mastery
