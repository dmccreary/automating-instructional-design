## About This MicroSim

This interactive diagram visualizes the three foundational layers of knowledge that instructional designers must consider when creating learning experiences. Understanding the distinction between assumed and prerequisite knowledge is crucial for effective course design.

### The Three Layers

1. **Assumed Knowledge (Bottom Layer)**: Knowledge learners are expected to already possess. No instruction or review is provided for this content. For example, a college-level writing course assumes students can read and form grammatically correct sentences.

2. **Prerequisite Knowledge (Middle Layer)**: Required foundational concepts that learners should have, but which may need review. These are often explicitly stated in course descriptions and may be assessed through diagnostic tests. For example, Calculus I requires Algebra and Trigonometry as prerequisites.

3. **New Content (Top Layer)**: The primary learning objectives for the current course or lesson. This is what learners will actively acquire through instruction.

### How to Use

1. **Hover** over any layer to see its full description, examples, and characteristics
2. Observe how each layer builds upon the one below it
3. Consider how this applies to your own course design

### Key Insights

- **Assumed knowledge gaps** can cause significant learning difficulties because instructors don't realize students are struggling with foundational concepts
- **Prerequisite knowledge** should be explicitly communicated and optionally assessed at course start
- **New content** must be carefully scaffolded to connect with existing knowledge structures

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. Define assumed knowledge, prerequisite knowledge, and new content
2. Explain the difference between assumed and prerequisite knowledge
3. Identify potential issues when assumed knowledge gaps exist
4. Design appropriate prerequisite assessments for a course

### Suggested Activities

1. **Exploration (5 min)**: Have students explore each layer, reading all descriptions and examples
2. **Case Analysis (10 min)**: Present scenarios where students struggled in a course; identify if the issue was assumed vs. prerequisite knowledge
3. **Course Audit (15 min)**: Students examine a syllabus and identify what is assumed, what is prerequisite, and what is new content
4. **Design Exercise (10 min)**: Students create a prerequisite checklist for a course they might teach

### Assessment

- Short quiz on distinguishing assumed vs. prerequisite knowledge
- Practical exercise: Create a knowledge inventory for a specific course
- Discussion: How would you address discovered gaps in assumed knowledge?
