## Description

This interactive visualization demonstrates five common relationship types used in educational knowledge graphs and concept maps. Understanding these relationship types is essential for creating effective learning graphs that accurately represent how concepts connect to one another.

## Edge Relationship Types

### Prerequisites (Solid Blue Arrow)

Indicates that one concept must be learned before another. This is a directional relationship commonly used in curriculum design and learning path planning.

**Example:** "Learning Objectives" is a prerequisite for "Instructional Design"

### Related To (Dashed Gray Line)

Indicates that two concepts share common themes, overlap in content, or are frequently discussed together. This is a bidirectional relationship.

**Example:** "Learning Objectives" is related to "Bloom's Taxonomy"

### Contrasts With (Solid Red Line)

Indicates that two concepts are opposites, have significant differences, or represent alternative approaches. This bidirectional relationship helps learners understand distinctions.

**Example:** "Summative Assessment" contrasts with "Formative Assessment"

### Exemplifies (Dotted Green Arrow)

Indicates that one concept is a specific example or instance of a broader concept. This directional relationship supports hierarchical understanding.

**Example:** "Summative Assessment" exemplifies "Assessment"

### Influences (Curved Purple Arrow)

Indicates that one concept affects, shapes, or has impact on another concept. This directional relationship shows cause-and-effect or indirect dependencies.

**Example:** "Bloom's Taxonomy" influences "Learning Objectives"

## Interactive Features

- **Click** on a legend item to highlight all edges of that relationship type
- **Click** on empty space in the graph to reset the view
- Use the **navigation buttons** to zoom and pan (when not embedded)

## Use Cases

These relationship types are useful for:

- **Curriculum Design:** Map prerequisite chains and related topics
- **Concept Mapping:** Show how ideas connect and contrast
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Build semantic relationships in educational ontologies
- **Learning Path Planning:** Identify dependencies and learning sequences

## Learning Objectives

After exploring this visualization, learners will be able to:

1. **Identify** five common relationship types used in knowledge graphs
2. **Distinguish** between directional and bidirectional relationships
3. **Apply** appropriate relationship types when creating concept maps
4. **Analyze** existing diagrams to identify relationship patterns
