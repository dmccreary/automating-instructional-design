## About This MicroSim

This interactive concept map visualizes the relationships between all 17 concepts covered in Chapter 1: Foundations of Learning Objective Analysis. The map shows how instructional design, Bloom's Taxonomy, learning objectives, and decomposition concepts interconnect.

### How to Use

1. **Click any node** to see its definition and highlight its connections
2. **Hover over nodes** to preview relationships
3. **Toggle edge labels** to show/hide relationship types
4. **Click "Reset"** to restore the default view

### Concept Categories

- **Core Concepts** (blue): Instructional Design, Educational Technology, Learning Objective
- **Bloom's Taxonomy** (purple): The taxonomy framework and Cognitive Complexity
- **Six Levels** (rainbow): Remember through Create
- **Objective Components** (green): Action Verbs, Measurable Outcomes, Learning Outcome
- **Decomposition** (orange): Objective Decomposition, Atomic Concepts, Compound Objectives

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. Trace relationships between Chapter 1 concepts
2. Explain how instructional design concepts interconnect
3. Identify the central role of learning objectives
4. Describe how Bloom's Taxonomy relates to other concepts

### Suggested Activities

1. **Exploration (5 min)**: Click each concept and read its definition
2. **Relationship Mapping (10 min)**: Identify three key relationships and explain them
3. **Self-Assessment (5 min)**: Rate your understanding of each concept (1-5)
4. **Extension (10 min)**: Add one new concept and its relationships to a paper copy
