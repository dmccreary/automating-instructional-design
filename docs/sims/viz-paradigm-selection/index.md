## Description

This interactive MicroSim helps learners choose the most appropriate visualization paradigm for their content. By answering simple questions about your data characteristics, you can quickly identify whether your content is best represented as a Timeline, Map, Network Graph, Chart, or Flowchart.

### How to Use

1. **Read the central question** at the top of the diagram
2. **Click on the visualization type** that matches your content characteristics
3. **Review the detailed information panel** that appears below with:
   - Description of when to use this visualization
   - Specific use cases
   - Real-world examples

### Visualization Paradigms

| Paradigm | Best For | Key Question |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Timeline** | Sequential events, history, schedules | Does your content show change over time? |
| **Map** | Geographic data, locations, spatial info | Does it show geographic locations? |
| **Network Graph** | Relationships, connections, dependencies | Does it show relationships between concepts? |
| **Chart** | Quantities, comparisons, statistics | Does it show quantities to compare? |
| **Flowchart** | Processes, decisions, algorithms | Does it show processes or workflows? |

## When to Use Each Visualization

### Timeline
- Project milestones and schedules
- Historical events and periods
- Process sequences over time
- Version history and evolution

### Map
- Store or facility locations
- Population or demographic data
- Weather patterns and forecasts
- Regional comparisons

### Network Graph
- Learning concept dependencies
- Organizational structures
- Social network connections
- System architecture diagrams

### Chart
- Sales and financial data
- Survey results and statistics
- Performance metrics
- Trend analysis

### Flowchart
- Decision-making processes
- Algorithm logic
- User journey flows
- System workflows

## Lesson Plan

### Objective
Students will understand the characteristics of different visualization paradigms and apply this knowledge to select appropriate visualizations for various types of content.

### Activities

1. **Exploration (5 minutes)**: Have students interact with the decision tree, clicking on each visualization type to learn its characteristics.

2. **Matching Exercise (10 minutes)**: Present students with various data scenarios and have them identify which visualization would be most appropriate:
   - Company sales figures over 5 years
   - Steps in the scientific method
   - Relationships between vocabulary terms
   - Customer locations across the country

3. **Application (15 minutes)**: Students select a topic from their own coursework and determine which visualization paradigm would best represent their content.

### Assessment
Students correctly match data types to visualization paradigms and justify their selections based on data characteristics.
