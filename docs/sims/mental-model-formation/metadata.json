  "description": "An interactive radial diagram showing how mental models form from six sources (Direct Experience, Observation, Instruction, Analogy, Intuition, Cultural Transmission) and influence predictions, interpretations, problem-solving, and communication. Demonstrates the filtering effect of existing models on new information and the feedback loop for model updates.",
