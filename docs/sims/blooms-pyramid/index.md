## About This MicroSim

This interactive pyramid visualizes the six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy, a framework for classifying educational learning objectives by cognitive complexity. The pyramid structure illustrates how higher-order thinking skills build upon lower-order foundations.

### How to Use

1. **Hover** over any level to see its description and keywords
2. **Click** on a level to view example learning objectives
3. **Click again** to deselect and explore other levels

### Key Concepts

- **Remember** (base): Retrieving relevant knowledge from long-term memory
- **Understand**: Constructing meaning from instructional messages
- **Apply**: Carrying out or using procedures in given situations
- **Analyze**: Breaking material into parts and detecting relationships
- **Evaluate**: Making judgments based on criteria and standards
- **Create** (top): Putting elements together to form novel wholes

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. List the six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy in order from lowest to highest cognitive complexity
2. Explain the hierarchical relationship between the levels
3. Identify appropriate action verbs for each cognitive level
4. Classify sample learning objectives by their Bloom's level

### Suggested Activities

1. **Exploration (5 min)**: Have students explore each level of the pyramid, reading descriptions and examples
2. **Verb Matching (10 min)**: Present a list of action verbs and have students identify which Bloom's level each belongs to
3. **Objective Classification (15 min)**: Provide 10 learning objectives and have students classify them by level
4. **Objective Writing (10 min)**: Students write one learning objective at each level for a topic of their choice

### Assessment

- Quiz on ordering the six levels correctly
- Matching exercise pairing action verbs to levels
- Practical assessment: Writing measurable learning objectives at specified levels
