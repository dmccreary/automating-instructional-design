# Think-Aloud Protocol

This interactive flowchart illustrates the think-aloud protocol methodology for gathering qualitative feedback on MicroSim usability. The think-aloud protocol is a powerful user experience research technique where participants verbalize their thoughts while interacting with an interface, revealing cognitive processes, confusion points, and usability issues.

## About This MicroSim

The workflow is organized into four color-coded phases:

1. **Preparation (Blue)** - Setting up the testing session and briefing participants
2. **Active Testing (Green)** - Observing the participant interact with the MicroSim
3. **Decision Points (Yellow)** - Key moments requiring facilitator judgment
4. **Analysis (Purple)** - Processing and documenting findings

**Interactions:**

- **Hover** over any step to see a detailed description
- **Click** a step to lock the description panel for reading

## Protocol Steps Explained

| Step | Phase | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1. Prepare Testing Session | Preparation | Set up recording equipment and consent forms |
| 2. Brief Participant | Preparation | Explain the method, reassure about testing focus |
| 3. Begin Recording | Active | Start capture, note time, begin session |
| 4. Participant Uses MicroSim | Active | Observe silently, take notes on behaviors |
| 5. Participant Stuck? | Decision | Assess if they need help to continue |
| 6. Provide Minimal Hint | Active | Give smallest possible nudge without revealing solutions |
| 7. Continue Observing | Active | Let them work through challenges naturally |
| 8. Task Complete? | Decision | Determine if finished or given up |
| 9. Conduct Debrief | Analysis | Ask follow-up questions about the experience |
| 10. Analyze Recording | Analysis | Review footage, code behaviors, timestamp key moments |
| 11. Document Insights | Analysis | Write findings report with recommendations |

## Key Principles

- **Test the design, not the user** - Always reassure participants that you are evaluating the MicroSim, not their intelligence or abilities
- **Minimal intervention** - Only provide hints when the participant is truly stuck, and keep hints as small as possible
- **Capture everything** - Record audio, video, and screen; take notes on non-verbal behaviors
- **Natural struggles are valuable** - Moments of confusion reveal usability issues that need fixing
- **Systematic analysis** - Use consistent coding schemes to identify patterns across participants

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level:** Professional Development / Graduate

**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**

- Apply the think-aloud protocol to gather qualitative feedback on MicroSim usability
- Distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate facilitator interventions
- Identify key decision points in the testing process

**Activities:**

1. **Explore the Flowchart (5 min)** - Click through each step to understand the protocol
2. **Role Play Setup (10 min)** - Practice briefing a mock participant
3. **Conduct Test Session (15 min)** - One person tests a MicroSim while verbalizing, another observes
4. **Debrief Discussion (10 min)** - Share observations and usability insights discovered
5. **Analysis Practice (5 min)** - Review notes and categorize findings

## Common Facilitator Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Problematic | Better Approach |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Explaining the interface | Masks usability issues | Let them discover on their own |
| Asking leading questions | Biases responses | Use neutral prompts like "What are you thinking?" |
| Intervening too quickly | Prevents natural recovery | Wait longer before offering hints |
| Taking sides with the design | Makes participant defensive | Stay neutral and curious |
| Not recording | Loses valuable data | Always capture audio/video/screen |
