## About This MicroSim

This interactive decision tree helps instructional designers and educators evaluate whether a learning objective is suitable for MicroSim development. The flowchart guides users through four key evaluation criteria to determine if a concept would benefit from an interactive simulation.

### How to Use

1. **Start** with a clearly defined learning objective
2. **Follow** the decision path through each evaluation branch
3. **Hover** over any node to see detailed descriptions
4. **Click** on decision nodes to view examples of Yes/No scenarios

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Interactivity**: Does the learning objective benefit from hands-on manipulation of variables, parameters, or objects?
- **Visualization**: Can the concept be represented visually through animations, graphs, diagrams, or spatial relationships?
- **Feedback**: Would immediate feedback on learner actions help accelerate understanding and correct misconceptions?
- **Scope**: Is the objective focused on a single, well-defined concept that can be explored in depth?

### Decision Outcomes

- **Ready for MicroSim**: The learning objective meets the criteria and would benefit from interactive simulation
- **Consider Other Formats**: The objective may be better served by reading materials, discussions, videos, or traditional exercises

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. Explain the four criteria for evaluating MicroSim readiness
2. Evaluate learning objectives against the readiness criteria
3. Justify decisions about MicroSim suitability for specific objectives
4. Identify alternative instructional formats for non-suitable objectives

### Suggested Activities

1. **Exploration (5 min)**: Navigate through all paths of the decision tree
2. **Analysis (10 min)**: Given 10 learning objectives, categorize each as MicroSim-ready or not
3. **Discussion (10 min)**: Debate borderline cases where criteria are partially met
4. **Application (15 min)**: Apply the framework to objectives from your own curriculum

### Assessment

- Quiz on identifying which criteria are most important for different types of content
- Practical: Evaluate 5 learning objectives from your subject area using the framework
