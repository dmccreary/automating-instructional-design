# Corporate Learning Module Workflow

This interactive flowchart demonstrates how to design time-efficient corporate training MicroSims. The workflow shows the complete learner journey through a typical 12-15 minute module, from launch to completion, with timing annotations at each step.

## About This MicroSim

The workflow is organized into three swimlanes representing the key perspectives:

1. **Learner Actions** - Activities the learner actively performs (assessments, practice, demonstrations)
2. **System Responses** - Automated system behaviors (content delivery, progress evaluation, job aids)
3. **Progress Tracking** - Decision points and completion milestones

**Color Coding:**

- **Blue** - Assessment activities (pre-assessment, diagnostic checks)
- **Green** - Learning activities (concept introduction, demonstrations)
- **Yellow** - Practice activities (guided and independent practice)
- **Orange** - Resource delivery (job aids, downloadable references)

**Interactions:**

- **Hover** over any node to see timing details and descriptions
- **Click** a node to lock the description panel for detailed reading
- Look for the green "S" badge indicating skip-available sections

## Workflow Steps Explained

| Step | Time | Category | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Module Launch | 0 sec | System | Module loads immediately with objectives and estimated completion time |
| 2. Pre-Assessment Check | 30 sec | Assessment | 3-question diagnostic to identify prior knowledge |
| 3. Knows Material? | - | Decision | Branch point: competent learners skip to practice |
| 4. Concept Introduction | 2 min | Learning | Brief explanation with workplace context |
| 5. Interactive Demonstration | 3 min | Learning | MicroSim showing concept in action with annotations |
| 6. Guided Practice | 3 min | Practice | Scaffolded practice with hints and immediate feedback |
| 7. Independent Practice | 3 min | Practice | Realistic scenario without scaffolding |
| 8. Job Aid Delivery | 30 sec | Resource | Downloadable reference for on-the-job use |
| 9. Module Complete | ~12 min | Completion | Total time for full path; 8-10 min with skip |

## Design Principles

This workflow demonstrates several key principles for effective corporate training:

### Time Efficiency

- **Total duration: 12-15 minutes** - Respects busy employee schedules
- **Pre-assessment skip path** - Experienced learners complete in 8-10 minutes
- **Progressive complexity** - Each step builds on the previous

### Workplace Integration

- **Contextual learning** - All examples tied to actual job tasks
- **Job aid delivery** - Downloadable reference for real work use
- **Mobile-friendly** - Learners can access on any device

### Evidence-Based Structure

- **Diagnostic assessment** - Identifies prior knowledge to personalize path
- **Demonstration before practice** - Shows correct approach first
- **Scaffolded to independent** - Gradually removes support for skill transfer

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level:** Professional Development / Corporate Training Designers

**Duration:** 20 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**

- Apply time-efficiency principles to corporate training module design
- Identify appropriate branch points for learner personalization
- Design balanced assessment-learning-practice sequences

**Activities:**

1. **Explore the Workflow (5 min)** - Click through each node to understand timing
2. **Trace Both Paths (5 min)** - Follow the full path and the skip path
3. **Calculate Timings (3 min)** - Add up times for each path to verify totals
4. **Adaptation Exercise (7 min)** - Sketch how you would modify this workflow for a specific training topic
