## About This MicroSim

This interactive Venn diagram helps learners understand set relationships through hands-on classification. The example compares properties of Cars (Set A) and Boats (Set B), requiring students to categorize items into four regions:

- **A only**: Properties unique to cars
- **B only**: Properties unique to boats
- **A and B (intersection)**: Properties shared by both
- **Neither**: Properties that apply to neither

### How to Use

1. **Drag** items from the panel on the right
2. **Drop** items into the appropriate Venn diagram region
3. **Receive feedback** - green for correct, red for incorrect with explanation
4. **Track your score** at the bottom of the canvas
5. **Reset** to try again

### Learning Objectives

By interacting with this MicroSim, learners will be able to:

1. Identify the four distinct regions of a two-set Venn diagram
2. Classify items based on shared and unique properties
3. Distinguish between set intersection, union, and complement
4. Apply logical reasoning to categorization problems

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level

Middle School through High School (adaptable for elementary with simpler categories)

### Duration

15-20 minutes

### Materials

- Computer or tablet with web browser
- Optional: printed Venn diagram worksheet for additional practice

### Suggested Activities

1. **Exploration (5 min)**: Students freely explore the MicroSim, dragging items and observing feedback
2. **Discussion (5 min)**: Class discusses the logic behind each placement - why does "Has wheels" belong only to Cars?
3. **Challenge (5 min)**: Students try to achieve a perfect score without any incorrect placements
4. **Extension (5 min)**: Students suggest new items that could be added to each category

### Assessment

- Completion with 100% accuracy
- Verbal explanation of why each item belongs in its region
- Creation of a new Venn diagram with different categories

## Customization Ideas

This MicroSim can be adapted for different subjects:

- **Biology**: Plants vs Animals
- **Grammar**: Nouns vs Verbs (with words that can be both)
- **Geography**: Coastal Cities vs Capital Cities
- **History**: Ancient Rome vs Ancient Greece
- **Math**: Even Numbers vs Multiples of 3
