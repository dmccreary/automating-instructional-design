# Design-Test-Refine Cycle

This interactive diagram illustrates the iterative process for systematically improving MicroSim quality through continuous testing and refinement. The cycle emphasizes that high-quality educational simulations emerge through repeated cycles of design, testing, analysis, prioritization, and refinement.

## About This MicroSim

The circular workflow shows five key phases arranged clockwise:

1. **DESIGN** (Blue) - Create initial implementation, apply design principles, and instrument for xAPI tracking
2. **TEST** (Green) - Run user testing sessions, collect analytics data, and gather qualitative feedback
3. **ANALYZE** (Yellow) - Interpret test results, identify patterns and issues, compare against criteria
4. **PRIORITIZE** (Orange) - Categorize issues (critical vs. nice-to-have), estimate effort, create ordered improvement list
5. **REFINE** (Purple) - Implement high-priority changes, update documentation, log changes for tracking

The center shows the goal: a **High-Quality MicroSim**. The **Deploy** arrow indicates the exit point when quality criteria are met.

## Key Insights

- **Iteration is essential** - Quality emerges through multiple cycles, not single passes
- **Data-driven decisions** - Testing and analytics guide improvement priorities
- **Systematic refinement** - Organized approach prevents ad-hoc, unfocused changes
- **Clear exit criteria** - Know when the MicroSim meets quality standards for deployment
- **Documentation matters** - Logging changes enables learning from the process

## Learning Objective

Students will apply the design-test-refine cycle to systematically improve MicroSim quality through iterative development.
