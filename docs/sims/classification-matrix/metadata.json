  "description": "An interactive p5.js MicroSim where learners drag and drop items to classify them using a 2x2 matrix with Complexity (High/Low) on the vertical axis and Impact (High/Low) on the horizontal axis. Quadrants are labeled Quick Wins, Strategic Projects, Fill-ins, and Time Sinks. Features draggable items, per-quadrant item counts, and a reset button.",
