## About This MicroSim

This interactive MicroSim presents a 2x2 classification matrix that helps learners practice categorizing items based on two criteria: **Complexity** (vertical axis) and **Impact** (horizontal axis). This is a common framework used in project prioritization, decision-making, and strategic planning.

### The Four Quadrants

1. **Quick Wins** (Low Complexity, High Impact) - Tasks that are easy to implement and deliver significant value. Prioritize these first.

2. **Strategic Projects** (High Complexity, High Impact) - Major initiatives requiring significant effort but delivering substantial value. Plan these carefully.

3. **Fill-ins** (Low Complexity, Low Impact) - Simple tasks with minimal impact. Do these when time permits.

4. **Time Sinks** (High Complexity, Low Impact) - Complex tasks with little return. Avoid or deprioritize these.

### How to Use

1. **Drag** items from the right panel
2. **Drop** them into the appropriate quadrant based on their complexity and impact
3. **View** the item count for each quadrant
4. **Reset** to start over and try different classifications

## Learning Objectives

By using this MicroSim, learners will be able to:

1. Apply a 2x2 classification framework to categorize items
2. Analyze tasks based on multiple criteria simultaneously
3. Make prioritization decisions using a structured approach
4. Recognize patterns in how items cluster within quadrants

## Customization

This MicroSim can be adapted for various classification scenarios:

- **Eisenhower Matrix**: Urgent/Not Urgent vs Important/Not Important
- **Risk Assessment**: Probability vs Impact
- **Learning Content**: Difficulty vs Relevance
- **Feature Prioritization**: Effort vs Value

## Lesson Plan

### Suggested Activities

1. **Exploration (5 min)**: Drag all items into quadrants based on your initial assessment
2. **Discussion (10 min)**: Compare classifications with peers and discuss differences
3. **Analysis (10 min)**: Identify which quadrant has the most items and discuss implications
4. **Application (15 min)**: Create your own list of items and classify them

### Assessment

- Justify why each item belongs in its assigned quadrant
- Propose an action plan based on the quadrant distribution
- Create a new classification matrix for a different domain
