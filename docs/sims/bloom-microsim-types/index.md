## About This MicroSim

This interactive pyramid infographic helps instructional designers understand which types of MicroSims are most appropriate for each cognitive level in Bloom's Taxonomy. The visualization maps specific simulation patterns to the six levels of cognitive complexity.

### How to Use

1. **Hover** over any pyramid level to see design considerations for that cognitive level
2. **Click** on a level to view a case study of a successful MicroSim implementation
3. **Click again** to deselect and explore other levels

### MicroSim Types by Level

| Level | Cognitive Process | Appropriate MicroSim Types |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **L1 - Remember** | Retrieving knowledge | Flashcard games, Matching exercises, Term sorters |
| **L2 - Understand** | Constructing meaning | Animated explanations, Cause-effect demos, Concept maps |
| **L3 - Apply** | Using procedures | Parameter sliders, Scenario testers, Problem solvers |
| **L4 - Analyze** | Breaking down, detecting relationships | Network graphs, Data explorers, Pattern identification tools |
| **L5 - Evaluate** | Making judgments | Comparison simulators, Trade-off analyzers, Judgment exercises |
| **L6 - Create** | Producing new work | Model editors, Free-form design tools, Hypothesis builders |

### Design Principles

When designing MicroSims for different cognitive levels:

- **Lower levels (Remember, Understand)**: Focus on clarity, repetition, and immediate feedback
- **Middle levels (Apply, Analyze)**: Emphasize parameter manipulation and relationship exploration
- **Higher levels (Evaluate, Create)**: Provide open-ended spaces for judgment and creation

## Embedding This MicroSim

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. Identify the six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy and their cognitive processes
2. Match MicroSim types to appropriate cognitive levels
3. Analyze the relationship between cognitive complexity and simulation design
4. Evaluate which MicroSim type best fits a given learning objective

### Suggested Activities

1. **Exploration (5 min)**: Have students explore each level of the pyramid, noting the MicroSim types and design considerations
2. **Matching Exercise (10 min)**: Present descriptions of MicroSims and have students classify them by Bloom's level
3. **Design Analysis (15 min)**: Review existing MicroSims and discuss whether their design matches the intended cognitive level
4. **Design Challenge (15 min)**: Given a learning objective, have students propose an appropriate MicroSim type with justification

### Assessment

- Quiz matching MicroSim types to Bloom's levels
- Analysis of existing simulations using the taxonomy framework
- Design proposal for a new MicroSim with cognitive level justification
