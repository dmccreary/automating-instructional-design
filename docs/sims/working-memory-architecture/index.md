## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates Baddeley's Working Memory Model, one of the most influential theories in cognitive psychology. The diagram illustrates how working memory processes and temporarily stores information through multiple specialized subsystems.

### Components of Working Memory

1. **Central Executive** (Purple) - The supervisory attention system that coordinates the slave systems, controls focus, and manages cognitive resources. Think of it as the "traffic controller" of working memory.

2. **Phonological Loop** (Blue) - Processes verbal and auditory information. It has two parts: a phonological store (the "inner ear" that holds speech-based information for 1-2 seconds) and an articulatory rehearsal process (the "inner voice" that refreshes information through subvocal repetition).

3. **Visuospatial Sketchpad** (Green) - Processes visual and spatial information. Used for mental imagery, navigation, and understanding spatial relationships between objects.

4. **Episodic Buffer** (Light Purple) - Added to the model in 2000, this component integrates information from the other subsystems and long-term memory into coherent episodes. It serves as a bridge between working memory and long-term memory.

5. **Long-Term Memory** (Gold) - The vast permanent storage system that provides context and prior knowledge to working memory processes.

### Interactive Features

- **Hover** over any component to see a detailed description of its function
- **Click** on any component to see specific examples of the type of information it processes
- Arrows show the flow of information between components
- The dashed boundary indicates the scope of working memory

### Capacity Limitations

A key insight from this model is that working memory has severe capacity limitations. The phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad can each hold approximately 4-7 "chunks" of information at a time. This limitation has profound implications for instructional design - presenting too much information simultaneously will overwhelm learners' working memory.

## Learning Objectives

After exploring this visualization, students will be able to:

- Identify the main components of Baddeley's Working Memory Model
- Explain the function of each working memory subsystem
- Describe how information flows between working memory components and long-term memory
- Recognize the dual-channel nature of working memory (verbal/auditory vs. visual/spatial)
- Understand why working memory capacity limitations matter for learning

## Lesson Plan Ideas

1. **Dual-Channel Processing**: Have students identify learning activities that use primarily the phonological loop vs. the visuospatial sketchpad. Discuss how multimedia presentations can engage both channels.

2. **Chunking Exercise**: Demonstrate working memory limits by having students memorize random letters (e.g., FBICIAIRS) vs. meaningful chunks (FBI, CIA, IRS). Discuss how prior knowledge from long-term memory helps working memory.

3. **Cognitive Load Analysis**: Analyze a sample lesson or interface for cognitive load. Identify elements that might overwhelm either the verbal or visual channel.

4. **Self-Reflection**: Have students identify which channel (verbal or visual) feels stronger for them personally. Discuss individual differences in working memory capacity.

5. **Instructional Design Application**: Given the working memory model, have students redesign an ineffective presentation or lesson to better manage cognitive load.
