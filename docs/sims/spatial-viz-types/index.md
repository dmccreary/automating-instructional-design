## Description

This interactive MicroSim displays six common types of spatial visualizations used in educational content, data presentation, and technical documentation. Each visualization type serves a specific purpose, and choosing the right one is essential for effective communication.

### Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Hover over each visualization type to learn about it
- **Icon Representations**: Each type features a distinctive icon
- **Use Case Guidance**: Tooltip shows when to use each visualization type
- **Example Applications**: Real-world examples for each category

### The Six Spatial Visualization Types

1. **Geographic Map** (Blue) - For showing location-based data and regional distribution across real-world geography

2. **Schematic Diagram** (Orange) - For showing system components and their logical connections without concern for physical scale

3. **Floor Plan** (Green) - For showing the layout of physical spaces, rooms, and navigation within buildings

4. **Anatomical View** (Red) - For showing internal structure of biological or complex systems with precise spatial relationships

5. **Network Topology** (Purple) - For showing connections between nodes, relationships, or data flow paths

6. **3D Model** (Teal) - For showing three-dimensional objects that need rotation or multiple viewing angles

## Choosing the Right Visualization

| Visualization Type | Best For | Avoid When |
|-------------------|----------|------------|
| Geographic Map | Real-world locations, regional data | Abstract relationships |
| Schematic Diagram | System architecture, workflows | Physical layouts |
| Floor Plan | Building navigation, space planning | Conceptual relationships |
| Anatomical View | Internal structures, layered systems | Simple components |
| Network Topology | Relationships, connections | Geographic accuracy matters |
| 3D Model | Physical objects, complex shapes | 2D sufficient |

## Lesson Plan

### Objective
Students will understand when to use different types of spatial visualizations and be able to select the appropriate type for a given communication goal.

### Activities

1. **Exploration (5 minutes)**: Have students hover over each visualization type to discover their use cases and examples.

2. **Discussion (10 minutes)**: As a class, discuss:
   - What makes each type unique?
   - Why would you choose a schematic over a floor plan?
   - When might you need a 3D model vs. a 2D diagram?

3. **Application (15 minutes)**: Give students various scenarios and have them identify which visualization type would be most effective:
   - Showing how a car engine works
   - Displaying sales data by country
   - Explaining computer network security
   - Planning an office renovation

4. **Creation (10 minutes)**: Have students sketch a simple example of one visualization type for a topic in their curriculum.

### Assessment
Students demonstrate understanding by correctly matching scenarios to visualization types and justifying their choices.
