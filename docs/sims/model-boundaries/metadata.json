  "title": "Model Boundaries - Projectile Motion",
  "description": "Interactive MicroSim demonstrating that all physics models have boundaries of applicability. Students explore four projectile motion models (naive, no air resistance, linear air resistance, full aerodynamic) and discover where each succeeds or fails based on launch parameters, projectile properties, and atmospheric conditions.",
