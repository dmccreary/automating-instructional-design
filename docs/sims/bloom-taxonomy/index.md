## Description

This interactive MicroSim displays Bloom's Revised Taxonomy as a colorful pyramid visualization. Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical framework used by educators to classify learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity.

### Features

- **Interactive Pyramid**: Hover over each level to explore its meaning
- **Detailed Information Panel**: Shows action verbs and examples for each cognitive level
- **Progress Tracking**: Counter in the upper-right shows how many levels you've explored
- **Celebration Animation**: View all six levels to trigger a colorful celebration
- **Click to Reset**: Click the counter after the celebration to start over

### The Six Cognitive Levels

From the base (lower-order thinking) to the apex (higher-order thinking):

1. **Remember** (Red) - Retrieving relevant knowledge from long-term memory
2. **Understand** (Orange) - Constructing meaning from instructional messages
3. **Apply** (Yellow) - Carrying out or using a procedure in a given situation
4. **Analyze** (Green) - Breaking material into parts and determining relationships
5. **Evaluate** (Blue) - Making judgments based on criteria and standards
6. **Create** (Purple) - Putting elements together to form a coherent whole

## Lesson Plan

### Objective
Students will understand and apply Bloom's Taxonomy to analyze and create effective learning objectives.

### Activities

1. **Exploration (5 minutes)**: Have students hover over each level of the pyramid to discover the action verbs and examples associated with each cognitive level.

2. **Discussion (10 minutes)**: As a class, discuss:
   - Why are the levels arranged in a pyramid?
   - What makes "Create" more complex than "Remember"?
   - How do the levels build upon each other?

3. **Application (15 minutes)**: Give students a topic from their curriculum and have them write one learning objective for each level of the taxonomy.

4. **Analysis (10 minutes)**: Have students exchange objectives with a partner and identify which level each objective represents using the action verbs from the MicroSim.

### Assessment
Students demonstrate understanding by correctly classifying learning objectives and creating their own objectives at multiple cognitive levels.
