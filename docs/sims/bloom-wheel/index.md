## About This MicroSim

This interactive wheel helps instructional designers and educators select appropriate action verbs when writing learning objectives. The wheel is organized by Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels, from lower-order thinking skills (Remember) to higher-order thinking skills (Create).

## How to Use

1. **Explore the wheel** - Hover over any section to see the Bloom's level description
2. **Click a verb** - Select any action verb to see its context and an example learning objective
3. **Generate Template** - Click the button to create a fill-in-the-blank learning objective template
4. **Random Verb** - Use this button to practice identifying appropriate verbs for different learning goals

## Bloom's Taxonomy Levels

| Level | Color | Description | Cognitive Complexity |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Remember** | Blue | Recall facts and basic concepts | L1 - Lowest |
| **Understand** | Green | Explain ideas or concepts | L2 |
| **Apply** | Yellow | Use information in new situations | L3 |
| **Analyze** | Orange | Draw connections among ideas | L4 |
| **Evaluate** | Pink | Justify a decision or course of action | L5 |
| **Create** | Purple | Produce new or original work | L6 - Highest |

## Action Verbs by Level

### Remember (L1)
list, define, recall, identify, name, recognize, locate, describe

### Understand (L2)
explain, summarize, interpret, classify, compare, contrast, exemplify, infer

### Apply (L3)
use, execute, implement, solve, demonstrate, calculate, apply, practice

### Analyze (L4)
differentiate, organize, attribute, compare, contrast, examine, deconstruct, distinguish

### Evaluate (L5)
judge, critique, assess, justify, prioritize, recommend, validate, defend

### Create (L6)
design, construct, develop, formulate, compose, produce, invent, generate

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Given a learning goal, students will be able to select appropriate action verbs that match the desired cognitive complexity level.

### Activities

1. **Verb Matching** (5 minutes) - Use the Random Verb button to generate a verb, then identify which Bloom's level it belongs to before revealing the answer

2. **Objective Writing** (10 minutes) - Select verbs from different levels and use the Generate Template feature to write learning objectives for your own course content

3. **Level Alignment** (5 minutes) - Review existing learning objectives and use the wheel to verify the verbs match the intended cognitive level

### Assessment
- Can students correctly identify the Bloom's level of given action verbs?
- Can students write learning objectives using appropriate verbs for specified cognitive levels?
- Can students explain why certain verbs indicate higher or lower cognitive complexity?

## Technical Notes

- Built with p5.js for responsive, interactive graphics
- Animation pauses when mouse leaves the canvas to save resources
- Supports keyboard accessibility for future enhancements
- Template generation copies to clipboard for easy use
