## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Add questions for high-centrality cognitive science concepts (Productive Failure, Conceptual Change)
2. Consider adding 2-3 more Analyze-level questions

### Medium Priority
1. Add coverage for visualization type subcategories (Distribution Chart, Correlation Display)
2. Include more questions about iteration workflow details

### Low Priority
1. Consider expanding Advanced Topics section
2. Add cross-references between related questions

---

## Suggested Additional Questions

Based on coverage gaps, consider adding:

1. "What is productive failure and how does it improve learning?" (Core Concepts - Analyze)
2. "How do I design simulations that promote conceptual change?" (Best Practices - Apply)
3. "What is a correlation display and when should I use it?" (Technical Details - Understand)
4. "How do schema formation principles affect MicroSim design?" (Core Concepts - Analyze)
5. "What is a distribution chart and what does it show?" (Technical Details - Remember)
