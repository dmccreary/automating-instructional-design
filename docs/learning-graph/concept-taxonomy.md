# Concept Taxonomy

This document defines the categorical taxonomy for organizing the 200 concepts in the Automating Instructional Design course learning graph.

## Taxonomy Categories

| TaxonomyID | Category Name | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| FOUND | Foundation Concepts | Core instructional design principles, prerequisites, and fundamental theories |
| BLOOM | Bloom's Taxonomy | Cognitive complexity levels and learning objective classification |
| VISUA | Visualization Types | Different paradigms for visual representation in MicroSims |
| LIBRA | Libraries & Tools | Specific JavaScript libraries and development tools |
| SPECI | Specification | Writing and documenting MicroSim requirements |
| COGNI | Cognitive Science | Memory, cognitive load, mental models, and misconceptions |
| AUDIE | Audience Adaptation | Designing for different age groups and contexts |
| EVALU | Evaluation & Testing | Quality assessment, rubrics, and user testing methods |
| ITERA | Iteration & Workflow | Design cycles, version control, and refinement processes |
| ACCES | Accessibility | Universal design, UDL principles, and inclusive design |
| DEPLO | Deployment | LMS integration, analytics, maintenance, and sharing |
| CAPST | Capstone | Portfolio projects and summative assessments |

## Category Definitions

### ACCES - Accessibility

Universal design principles and inclusive design practices.

**Includes:** Universal Design, UDL Principles, Screen Reader Support, Keyboard Navigation, Color Blindness Design, Reduced Motion, Multilingual Support

### DEPLO - Deployment

Integration with learning management systems, analytics, and long-term maintenance.

**Includes:** LMS Integration, Intelligent Textbook, Learning Analytics, Interaction Tracking, Maintenance Planning, Library Organization, Content Sharing

### CAPST - Capstone

Portfolio projects and summative assessment concepts.

**Includes:** Portfolio Project, Reflection Journal, Peer Feedback, Self-Evaluation

## Distribution Goals

- Target: ~12-25 concepts per category
- No single category should exceed 30% of total concepts
- MISC category should be minimal (<2%)
