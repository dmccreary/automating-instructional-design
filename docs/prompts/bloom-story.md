# Bloom Story

!!! prompt
    I want to add a 12-panel mini-graphic novel about the creation of the Bloom taxonomy featuring no only the original Bloom taxonomy, but the upgrades to the 2001 taxonomy done by Bloom's students. Please generate the narrative for this graphic novel and place detailed descriptions of each panel in a ## Panel N level 2 header. This description should be in a <details> block and it will be used by a text-to-image generator. Use a classic graphic novel hero's journey story arc. Make Bloom's work have lasting impact on automated instructional design tools.
