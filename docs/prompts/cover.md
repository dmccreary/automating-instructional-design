# Cover Image Prompt


Please generate a new image.

A wide landscape book cover background (1.91:1 ratio) for "Automating Instructional Design". Deep blue-to-teal gradient background with a montage of educational technology elements: glowing neural network patterns, network graph visualizations with connected nodes, timeline bars, small charts and graphs, flowchart arrows, animated particle trails, a stylized 6-level pyramid in graduated colors representing Bloom's Taxonomy, interactive UI elements like sliders and buttons, lightbulb icons, interconnected gears, and abstract human-AI collaboration imagery. Modern flat design aesthetic with warm orange and purple accents. Elements softly fade toward edges, leaving center darker for white title text overlay. Professional, tech-forward, educational mood. No text in image.

  Cover Image Description for "Automating Instructional Design"

  Format: Wide landscape, 1.91:1 aspect ratio (e.g., 1910×1000 pixels)

  Central Title Area: Reserve center space for white text "Automating Instructional Design" on a semi-transparent dark overlay or gradient.  Place the word "Automating" on the first line and "Instructional Design" on the second line.

  Background Montage Elements

  AI & Human Collaboration (Left Region):
  - A glowing neural network pattern or brain-circuit hybrid symbolizing AI
  - Stylized chat bubbles or prompt interface suggesting human-AI dialogue
  - Abstract representation of Claude/AI assistant (perhaps a subtle geometric owl or abstract assistant icon)

  Visualization Paradigms (Distributed Throughout):
  - Network graph nodes and edges (vis-network style) showing connected concepts
  - A timeline bar with milestone markers
  - Small chart elements: bar charts, line graphs, or pie charts
  - A mini geographic map outline with data points (Leaflet-style)
  - Flowchart/diagram arrows suggesting Mermaid diagrams
  - Animated particle trails or physics-based motion paths (p5.js aesthetic)

  Bloom's Taxonomy Reference (Right Region):
  - A stylized pyramid or stacked hexagons in 6 graduated colors (from deep purple/red at base through orange, yellow, green, blue to violet at top)
  - Or abstract stepping stones ascending representing cognitive levels

  Educational/Learning Elements (Scattered):
  - Lightbulb icons (insight/learning)
  - Gear mechanisms (process/automation)
  - Interconnected puzzle pieces (integration)
  - Abstract human silhouettes in learning poses
  - Graduation cap or book icons (subtle, not dominant)

  MicroSim Aesthetic:
  - Interactive slider controls
  - Play/pause buttons
  - Canvas/frame borders suggesting simulation windows
  - Cursor or touch indicators showing interactivity

  Color Palette

  - Primary: Deep blue (#1a237e) to teal (#00695c) gradient background
  - Accents: Warm orange (#ff7043), bright yellow (#ffd54f), electric purple (#7c4dff)
  - Highlights: White and soft cyan glows
  - Overall mood: Professional, modern, tech-forward but educational

  Style Direction

  - Aesthetic: Modern flat/semi-flat design with subtle depth
  - Complexity: Medium density—enough visual interest without overwhelming
  - Cohesion: Elements should feel interconnected, perhaps with subtle connecting lines or gradient flows
  - Edges: Soft fade/vignette toward edges to draw focus to center title
  - Texture: Subtle noise or grain for print-ready quality
