Go into the @docs/chapters area and analize all the #### Diagram sections that have a <details> that has not been
 worked on to create a MicroSim in @docs/sims.  If you find a corrisponding MicroSim, please add the string 
"Status:done" to the <details>.  If there is no evidence that the MicroSim has been created yet, run the 
microsim-matcher and then from the top candidates, run the microsim-generator skill on the best match.  Do not stop
 to ask for any premissions.  Just do your best to create the best MicroSim for each diagram.  If you think the 
microsim might not be of high quality, add a TODO: human-review-needed to each <details> section.  At the end, 
create a report of the MicroSims you have created and your confidence level it is of good quality.
