## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Panel Titles

Replaced generic panel numbers with descriptive, story-driven titles:

| Panel | Original Title | New Title |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | What is Learning | The Problem of Learning |
| 2 | How Do We Classify Learning? | A Question in the Dark |
| 3 | Panel 3 | The Council of Minds |
| 4 | Panel 4 | The First Structure Emerges |
| 5 | The Global Classroom | A Framework Spreads Across the World |

| 7 | Panel 7 | Rewriting the Language of Learning |
| 8 | Panel 8 | A Living Taxonomy |
| 9 | Panel 9 | Bridging Minds and Machines |
| 10 | Futuristic classroom with adaptive learning tools | Learning at Scale |
| 11 | Panel 11 | The Invisible Infrastructure |
| 12 | Panel 12 | A Legacy That Creates |

### 2. Added Narrative Paragraphs

Added a single paragraph of narrative text after each panel's `</details>` block to create a cohesive story flow:

| Panel | Narrative Focus |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Post-WWII educational chaos, GI Bill influx, Bloom recognizes need for order |
| 2 | Bloom's solitary late-night struggle to organize human learning |
| 3 | Assembling the team of scholars, passionate debates about cognition |
| 4 | 1956 publication of *Taxonomy of Educational Objectives*, shared language created |
| 5 | Global adoption across education systems, but hints of incompleteness |
| 6 | 1990s challenges: computers, cognitive science discoveries, static language critiques |
| 7 | Krathwohl leads revision, nouns become verbs, Create rises to top |
| 8 | 2001 revision adds Knowledge Dimension (Factual, Conceptual, Procedural, Metacognitive) |
| 9 | Taxonomy becomes protocol for human-machine communication about learning |
| 10 | AI generates curricula, adaptive platforms track progress in real time |
| 11 | Bloom's ideas embedded invisibly in modern education infrastructure |
| 12 | Closing reflection: human-centered theory guides both educators and machines |

## Story Arc

The narrative follows a classic hero's journey structure:

1. **The Problem** (Panels 1-2): Post-war educational confusion, Bloom's call to adventure
2. **The Quest** (Panels 3-4): Collaboration, breakthrough, the taxonomy emerges
3. **The Spread** (Panel 5): Global adoption and success
4. **The Challenge** (Panel 6): Cracks appear, world changes, torch must be passed
5. **The Renewal** (Panels 7-8): Krathwohl's revision, living taxonomy
6. **The Bridge** (Panels 9-10): Human-machine connection, AI integration
7. **The Legacy** (Panels 11-12): Invisible infrastructure, enduring human-centered vision

## Notes

- Each panel contains a `<details>` block with image generation prompts
- Prompts specify 16:9 wide-landscape format, graphic novel style
- Character consistency maintained for Benjamin Bloom throughout
- Visual language uses recurring symbols: tangled lines (confusion), pyramids/ladders (insight), grids (clarity)
- Later panels (10-11) shift to brighter, modern academic tone
