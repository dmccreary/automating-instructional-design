# Chapter 9 Generation Log

## Session Information

- **Date:** 2025-12-18
- **Skill Version:** 0.03
- **Chapter:** 09-generating-microsims-ai-tools
- **File:** `/docs/chapters/09-generating-microsims-ai-tools/index.md`

## User Instructions

- Writing level: College students or business professionals
- Tone: Fun, optimistic with holistic view that automating instructional design makes the world better
- Include puns and jokes to lighten tone
- No leading spaces in `<details>` text

### Special Emphasis Requested

1. **Claude Code Skills** - Context window strategies, intelligent content loading
2. **30-skill limit** - Only ~100 token summaries in context window
3. **Rule hierarchies for consistency** - Enterprise, business unit, department, project, personal levels
4. **Conflict resolution** - Similar to CSS `!important` mechanism
5. **Pros/cons of hierarchy depth** - Multiple levels vs. fewer repositories

### Details Blocks Requiring Implementation

1. **MicroSim Generation Workflow** (workflow) - 5-phase flowchart with decision diamonds
2. **Prompt Engineering Best Practices** (infographic) - Card-based checklist
3. **Claude Code Skills Architecture** (diagram) - Context window visualization
4. **Rule Hierarchy Cascade** (diagram) - Animated cascade demonstration
5. **Issue Identification Workflow** (workflow) - 7-checkpoint decision tree
6. **Iteration Management Dashboard** (infographic) - Multi-panel tracking tool

### Special Content Added

**Claude Code Skills Section:**
- Context window challenge and solution
- 30-skill limit explained with strategic choices table
- ~100 token summary indexing mechanism
- On-demand loading architecture
- Skill anatomy template
- Library/card catalog metaphor

**Rule Hierarchies Section:**
- 5-level hierarchy model
- Example rules at each level with markdown code blocks
- Conflict resolution via specificity principle
- `[MANDATORY]`, `[RECOMMENDED]` override markers
- 4 repository implementation options (hierarchical files, flat with tags, single file, database)
- Pros/cons comparison table for hierarchy depth
- Recommendation: Start with 3 levels, add as needed

## Key Sections

1. Introduction: Your New AI Collaborator
2. The Generation Workflow (5 phases)
3. Prompt Engineering (anatomy of effective prompts)
4. Claude Code Skills (context management, 30-skill limit)
5. Building Consistency with Rule Hierarchies
6. Refinement Prompts (patterns and flow)
7. Output Interpretation (5 assessment levels)
8. Issue Identification (categories and triage)
9. The Regeneration Decision (matrix and hybrid approach)
10. Manual Adjustment (when and how)
11. Version Control (git workflow for AI work)
12. Iteration Management (logs, stopping criteria, anti-patterns)
13. Putting It All Together (complete workflow)
14. Summary
15. References and Further Reading

## Notes

- Chapter is highly meta - about using AI to generate MicroSims while being generated by AI
- Extensive practical guidance with code examples
- Rule hierarchy section draws explicit parallel to CSS cascade
- Includes PREDICT framework mnemonic (not in concepts but useful addition)
- Emphasizes hybrid approach (AI + manual) throughout
