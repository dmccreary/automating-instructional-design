Finally, you will complete your portfolio project, maintain a reflection journal, engage in peer feedback, and conduct self-evaluation to demonstrate mastery.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/12-accessibility-deployment-completion/#concepts-covered","title":"Concepts Covered","text":"<p>This chapter covers the following 27 concepts from the learning graph:</p> <ol> <li>Color Accessibility</li> <li>Contrast Design</li> <li>Universal Design</li> <li>UDL Principles</li> <li>Screen Reader Support</li> <li>Keyboard Navigation</li> <li>Color Blindness Design</li> <li>Reduced Motion</li> <li>Multilingual Support</li> <li>Vocabulary Level</li> <li>Cultural Sensitivity</li> <li>Prior Knowledge Support</li> <li>Differentiation Strategy</li> <li>Accessibility Audit</li> <li>Constraint Simulation</li> <li>LMS Integration</li> <li>Intelligent Textbook</li> <li>Learning Analytics</li> <li>Interaction Tracking</li> <li>Maintenance Planning</li> <li>Library Organization</li> <li>Educator Collaboration</li> <li>Content Sharing</li> <li>Portfolio Project</li> <li>Reflection Journal</li> <li>Peer Feedback</li> <li>Self-Evaluation</li> </ol>"},{"location":"chapters/12-accessibility-deployment-completion/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>This chapter builds on concepts from:</p> <ul> <li>Chapter 7: Cognitive Load and Visual Design</li> <li>Chapter 10: Quality Evaluation Frameworks</li> <li>Chapter 11: User Testing and Iteration</li> </ul> <p>TODO: Generate Chapter Content</p>"},{"location":"learning-graph/","title":"Learning Graph for Automating Instructional Design","text":"<p>This section contains the learning graph for this textbook.
