Learners take an action, observe a consequence, adjust their mental model, and try again. This cycle mirrors how humans naturally learn through experience.</p> Passive Learning Interactive Learning Watch a video about gravity Drop virtual objects and observe acceleration Read about supply and demand Adjust price and quantity sliders, watch market response Listen to a lecture on recursion Step through a recursive algorithm visually Memorize sorting algorithm steps Watch algorithms race to sort different datasets <p>The problem with traditional interactive simulations is that they're expensive and time-consuming to build.

Integration beats separation every time.</p> <p>Visual Simplicity and Information Density: Less is usually more. Every element should earn its place.</p> <p>Progressive Disclosure: Reveal complexity gradually.

How could something as vast and varied as human learning be organized into categories that any teacher, in any subject, could use? He sketched ladders that went nowhere and pyramids that collapsed under scrutiny. The human mind wasn't a filing cabinet\u2014it was a living thing, growing and connecting in ways that defied simple labels. Yet Bloom refused to give up.

Bloom and his colleagues stand at the base, looking upward with awe. This represents the breakthrough: learning can be structured and shared.  <p>In 1956, the team published their masterwork: Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. The framework presented learning as a journey upward through six cognitive levels\u2014from simple recall of facts to the heights of evaluation and judgment.
